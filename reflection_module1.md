# ðŸ¤” What I'm Still Confused About

My main confusion lies in understanding the relationship between this workshop repository  
`module-1-part-1-git-and-github-practice-tangwhiap` and our GitHub classroom setup.

Specifically, I have the following questions:

- Is this repository a **"copy"** or fork of the GitHub Classroom repository we used in class?
- Is this my **personal workspace**, meaning I can't view other students' work here?
- When I create a **pull request**, does that mean my changes are intended to be merged into the **class repository**?
